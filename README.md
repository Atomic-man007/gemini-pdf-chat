# PDF Chat Application using Gemini ðŸ’¬

## Overview

This Python application utilizes the [Gemini](https://google.generativeai.dev/gemini) model to enable users to interact with the text content of PDF files through a conversational interface. The application processes PDF files, extracts text data, splits it into chunks, and creates a vector store for efficient querying.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Create a `.env` file and add the required environment variables:
     - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google API key for Gemini model access.

3. **Run the Application:**
   - Execute the main script `main.py`:

     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

4. **Use the Streamlit UI:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the provided Streamlit UI.
   - Upload PDF files containing the content you want to interact with.
   - Enter a question in the input box and click "Submit & Process" to get a response based on the PDF content.

## Code Structure

- `main.py`: The main script containing the Streamlit UI and the core functionalities.
- `langchain`: A module for various language processing functionalities.
- `models`: Model files used for embeddings and similarity search.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Important Notes

- Make sure to handle your Google API key securely and avoid sharing it publicly.
- The application uses the Gemini model for generative AI responses. Ensure compliance with Google's terms of service.
